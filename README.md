# cycle-remote-data

`cycle-remote-data` is a Cycle.js driver for fetching and sending data over HTTP.

`@cycle/http` is the official HTTP driver for Cycle.js. `cycle-remote-data` attempts to improve over `@cycle/http` in a number of ways. When using `@cycle/http`, it is easy to forget to handle errors, which then crash your application. Successfully handling errors is not easy, and if you are using a type checker can be extra painful.

Additionally, it is often useful to be able to show feedback in the UI when loading data, or when data loading has not yet started. This is also not always straightforward with `@cycle/http`.

[krisajenkins](https://github.com/krisajenkins), author of the [Elm library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/krisajenkins/remotedata/latest) that inspired this one, has an [excellent blog post](http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/how-elm-slays-a-ui-antipattern.html) describing this problem generically.

With `cycle-remote-data`, you can call `sources.RemoteData.request({url: '/search?q=hi', method: 'GET')`, which returns a `MemoryStream` of `RemoteData` objects.

There are four possible states: `Ok`, `Error`, `Loading` and `NotAsked`. When working with `RemoteData` objects, we handle all of these possibilities.

When using TypeScript in strict mode, the compiler will even catch any cases we fail to handle!


## Install

```bash
$ npm install cycle-remote-data
```

## Usage

First, we want to import `makeRemoteDataDriver` and add it to our drivers.

```ts
import { makeRemoteDataDriver } from 'cycle-remote-data';

const drivers = {
  DOM: makeDOMDriver('.app'),
  RemoteData: makeRemoteDataDriver()
}
```

Then, inside of our main, we can use `sources.RemoteData.request` to make requests.

```ts
function main(sources) {
  const results$ = sources.RemoteData.request({
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=cycle'
  });
}
```

If you've used `@cycle/http`, you'll notice some differences. First of all, we can make requests with a method in sources, rather than from our sinks. Secondly, instead of a stream of streams, we're just working with a flat stream of RemoteData states.

One nice similarity is that `cycle-remote-data` expects requests in the same format as `@cycle/http`, and uses the exact same code under the hood to turn that into a `superagent` request.

So we have a stream of `RemoteData` states, but what is a `RemoteData`? If we print it out, we see an object with two methods, `when` and `rmap`.

`RemoteData` is an interface across four possible states, named `Ok`, `Error`, `Loading` and `NotAsked`. Notice that there is no `type` or identifying information present in a `RemoteData` object.

So how do we work with the data we've loaded? That's where `when` comes into play.

Let's map over our `result$` and put it into a `view`.


```ts
function main(sources) {
  const results$ = sources.RemoteData.request({
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=cycle'
  });

  return {
    DOM: results$.map(view)
  }
}
```

So how do we define our view?

```ts
function view(remoteData) {
  return remoteData.when({
    Ok: response => div(JSON.stringify(response.body)),
    Error: () => div('An error occurred loading data...'),
    Loading: () => div('Loading...'),
    NotAsked: () => div('')
  })
}
```

We can use the `when` method to handle all of the possible cases. Our `RemoteData` will start out `Loading`, and then progress into either `Ok` or `Error`.

Whenever the `RemoteData` state changes our `results$` will update, and our `when` will be called again.

You may wonder where `NotAsked` comes into it. `NotAsked` is not a state that `cycle-remote-data` will ever emit, but it can be useful to import `NotAsked` and `.startWith(NotAsked)`.

This is useful for example when you have a search box, and you want it to say 'Type something to search' when nothing has been searched or it has been cleared.

The above example does have an ugly part, in that we are working with responses directly in our view. What we need is a way to apply functions to the `Ok` value before calling `when`.

This is where `rmap` is handy. We could alter our main function to pull the body off of the response.

```ts
function main(sources) {
  const response$ = sources.RemoteData.request({
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=cycle'
  });

  const results$ = response$.map(remoteData => remoteData.rmap(response => response.body));

  return {
    DOM: results$.map(view)
  }
}
```

`remoteData.rmap` takes a function that transforms the response. This is why `RemoteData` is actually a generic interface in TypeScript.

When you call `RemoteData.request`, you're actually getting a `MemoryStream<RemoteData<superagent.Response>>`. Calling `.rmap` on the `RemoteData` will return a `RemoteData` with the generic type of the return value of your `rmap` function.

## Example

This is a larger example that includes a `reload` button on errors, uses a `NotAsked` state at the start, and cancels old requests when new searches are made.

```ts
import {makeRemoteDataDriver, NotAsked} from '../src';
import {makeDOMDriver, div, input, button} from '@cycle/dom';
import {timeDriver} from '@cycle/time';
import {run} from '@cycle/run';
import xs from 'xstream';

function GithubSearch(sources) {
  const query$ = sources.DOM
    .select('.search')
    .events('input')
    .map(ev => ev.target.value)
    .remember();

  const reload$ = sources.DOM
    .select('.reload')
    .events('click');

  const search$ = xs.merge(
    query$.compose(sources.Time.debounce(250)),
    reload$
  );

  const searchWithQuery$ = search$.map(() => query$.take(1)).flatten();

  const post$ = searchWithQuery$
    .map(query =>
      query === ''
        ? xs.of(NotAsked)
        : sources.RemoteData.request({
            url: `https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=${query}`,
            method: 'GET'
          })
    )
    .flatten()
    .map(remoteData => remoteData.rmap(response => response.body))
    .startWith(NotAsked);

  return {
    DOM: post$.map(view)
  }
}

function view(remotePost) {
  return div([
    'Search github',
    input('.search'),

    remotePost.when({
      Loading: loadingView,
      Error: errorView,
      Ok: postsView,
      NotAsked: notAskedView
    })
  ]);
}

function errorView() {
  return div([
    'Error loading content',
    button('.reload', "Reload")
  ])
}

function loadingView() {
  return div('Loading...')
}

function notAskedView() {
  return div([
    'Search for something!'
  ])
}

function postsView(posts) {
  return div([
    JSON.stringify(posts)
  ])
}

const drivers = {
  DOM: makeDOMDriver(document.body),
  RemoteData: makeRemoteDataDriver(),
  Time: timeDriver
}

run(GithubSearch, drivers);
```

## API

### `makeRemoteDataDriver()`

This is a function that returns a remote data driver. The remote data driver is also a function, that takes no arguments and returns a `RemoteDataSource`.

### `RemoteDataSource.request(requestOptions)`

The `RemoteDataSource` contains a single function, `request`, which takes a single options argument. For documentation of the options you can pass, please see the [`@cycle/http` docs](https://cycle.js.org/api/http.html).

`RemoteDataSource.request()` returns a `MemoryStream` of `RemoteData<superagent.Response>` states.

### `RemoteData<T>`

`RemoteData<T>` is a generic interface with four possible constructors: Ok, Error, Loading and NotAsked. The only state directly available is `NotAsked`, so that it can be used by users.

`RemoteData<T>` is satisfied by two methods:

#### `when(cases: Cases<T, U>): U`

Takes an object of cases. The following cases must be handled, with the provided signatures:

```ts
interface Cases<T, U> {
  Ok(t: T): U;
  Error(err: Error): U;
  Loading(progress: number): U;
  NotAsked(): U;
}
```

If a case is not handled, a runtime error can occur. For this reason, it's recommended to use TypeScript in strict mode.

#### `rmap(f: (t: T) => U): RemoteData<U>`

`rmap` is used for applying functions to the `Ok` value. A `RemoteData<T>` would have an `Ok` value of type `T`. Applying a function that translates from `T => U` would return a `RemoteData<U>`.


## FAQ

*****Doesn't this go against Cycle's idioms? You're using a source method for write effectsâ€½**

Yes, it does conflict with Cycle's current ideology. However, HTTP is a complex problem to model in Cycle, as it is a combination of intertwined read and write effects.

I think it's important to be willing to try different approaches. Perhaps we will find out some non-obvious pros or cons that we never would have encountered if we weren't willing to think differently.


**Maybe this is okay for GET requests, but do you seriously advocate using it for POST/PUT/DELETE/etc?**

I'm personally not sure. I think it depends on what feedback you need to give the user on the outcome of the request.

If it turns out that this feels very wrong, I'll consider handling POST/PUT/DELETE via sinks instead, like `@cycle/http`.

## Types

`cycle-remote-data` provides a few useful type definitions.

```ts
import {RemoteDataSource, RemoteData, RemoteResponse} from 'cycle-remote-data';
```

`RemoteResponse` is a shorthand for `RemoteData<superagent.Response>`, which is the type of the items in the stream return by `request`.
